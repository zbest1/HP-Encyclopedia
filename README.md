# HP-Encyclopedia
This application was built using Mongoose, Javascript, and JQuery. It includes full CRUD. Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS. MVC was adhered to - I just used different names. 

The approach to the project:

- I wanted to build something that would continue to be developed by myself and family members after the initial project delivery. I decided on a web site and database about Harry Potter. I draw up a rough sketch of my initial idea and once approved, I proceeded to research current web sites that have Harry Potter content. This included, Universal Studios, Pottermore, and other well known Harry Potter sites.  

- While solidifying by design, I created a working CRUD structure in Mongoose. Once that was working, I went back to the design, and decided to take a more visual approach to display. I also worked through the flow of information, and drew up a very rough sketch of development as well as a project plan for each day.

Unsolved Problems & Things I Would Like to Continue Working On:
- Change the file paths so it is move intuitive and user friendly. 
- I would have liked to include a slide out navigation bar - which is still in the works but I couldn't finish it. 
- Add a search bar. I know what to do, I just didn't have time. 
- I also have plans to add animated footsteps. I have the rough code, I just need to create the foot prints in Photoshop and finish working out the JavaScript. 
- I also wanted to add another animation on the landing page: On click the book spins and shrinks. 
- I also plan to add a smoother transition to the search page - just to soften the transition.
- Issues: There seems to be a problem with the wand elements - the field shows sometimes when it shouldn't - which wasn't a problem before. I need to debug. 
- Clean up the code. Remove unused code. I have code that I plan to use, but it is not doing anything at the moment. Remove it and save it somewhere else and keep the base code clean.
